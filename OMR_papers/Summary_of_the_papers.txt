Optical Music Recognition is a field of research that investigates how to
computationally read music notation in documents

OMR vs text recognition
1) OMR is a heavily contextual writing system 

2) OMR require that we also retrive the semantic aside from just the text
notation like in text recognition 

3) To make matters worse, the correct interpretation depends on conventions,
which can change depending on social, historical, or professional context (what
a jazz musician accepts as conventional will differ from that understood by a
classical player, for example)

4) Wide range of variability of primitive symbols 

5) Require lots of 2D spatial relationship

OMR input:
2 types: Offline and Online OMR

Offline OMR operate on a static image and Online is real time with the musician
writing the notes on a digital tablet 

Online is easier than Offline OMR
